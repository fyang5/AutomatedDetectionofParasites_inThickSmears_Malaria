# AutomatedDetectionofParasites_inThickSmears_Malaria

Codes are initially wrote in matlab and the related work is published in IEEE JBHI and MICCAI 2019. The codes are converted by Mr. Hang Yu for running on Malaria Screener APP: https://github.com/nlm-malaria/MalariaScreener.

The dataset is available in: https://data.lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/public/Malaria/Thick_Smears_150/index.html and https://ieee-dataport.org/documents/malaria-thick-blood-smears.

Please cite the two papers below if you used our codes or data.
